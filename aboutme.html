      <h2>Short Biography:</h2>
      <p>My name is Leslie Sanchez and I will become Junior in high school in the fall of 2017. I applied to GWC because I wanted to learn more about coding and how it works. I am very excited to learn more about computers at GWC and meet new people. I alsolike to dance and I am in a dance program at my school. It is a mixture of jazz and ballet and I really enjoy it. I also love animals and have a dog of my own named Chela.</p>

<h2>Fun Fact!</h2>
<p>A fun fact about me is that I am actually a black belt in Gung-Fu.<br>Mamny people ask me if it's<strong>Kung-Fu</strong>, but it's a completely different thing.</p>
<h2>Links to my favorite Webpages</h2>
To be honest, I don't really have many <i>websites</i> that I visit often. Nevertheless, here are my links to <a href="https://twitter.com/selftjtIed">my Twitter</a>,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/guilttrjpping/?hl=en">my Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://www.snapchat.com/"><title=My Snapchat is jdkrn btw. ;)>my Snapchat.</a>  
  <h2>Side-Scroller Game</h2>
  <p>This is a game that we made in partners, but I had a group of 3. The game is called <i>Entity Escape</i> and it's a Halloween based game.<br>The idea of the game is to avoid the ghosts and ghouls and try to get as much candy as possible.<br>I had a lot of fun creating this game and although my group and I had some obstacles, we pulled though in the end.</p>
