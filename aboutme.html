      <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio page. Feel free to browse around. :)</p>
      <h2>Short Biography:</h2>
      <p>My name is Leslie Sanchez and I will become Junior in high school in the fall of 2017. I go to Mt. Eden High School in Hayward and I really like it. I also have a dog named Chela which I love very much and I will (maybe) talk more about her later. I come from a Mexican background and I love my heritage.</p>
