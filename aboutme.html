      <h2>Short Biography:</h2>
      <p>My name is Leslie Sanchez and I will become Junior in high school in the fall of 2017. I applied to GWC because I wanted to learn more about coding and how it works. I am very excited to learn more about computers at GWC and meet new people. I alsolike to dance and I am in a dance program at my school. It is a mixture of jazz and ballet and I really enjoy it. I also love animals and have a dog of my own named Chela.</p>
